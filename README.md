# Learning Typescript

This repository is my personal playground for learning TypeScript. Feel free to browse the code and notes in each folder.

## About TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, and supports tools for large-scale JavaScript applications.

## What's in This Repository?

This repository contains a collection of TypeScript files, each demonstrating different concepts in TypeScript. It also includes my notes from the learning process. 

## How to Use This Repository?

To run any TypeScript file, you will first need to install TypeScript. You can install it globally using npm:

```
npm install -g typescript
```


Then, to compile a TypeScript file to JavaScript, you can use the `tsc` command:

```
tsc myfile.ts
```
